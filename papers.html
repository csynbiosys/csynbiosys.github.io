        <h2>P7 Sex differences in macrophage-mediated endothelin-1 clearance</h2>
        <h3>G Sutton, A Czopek, T Krueger, F Menolascina, N Dhaun</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Introduction Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease. However, its causes remains unclear in most cases. Our recent data suggests that macrophages contribute to, and protect from, hypertension by regulating the endothelin (ET) system [Czopek, Eur Heart J 2019]. ET-1 is the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictor with pro-inflammatory properties. We have shown that macrophage remove ET-1 through the ETB receptor (ETBR). As cardiovascular risk varies between men and women, here we explored if the expression of the ET system and ET-1 clearance varies between male and female mice and with macrophage phenotype. Method Bone marrow derived macrophage from 9–12 weeks old male (n=5) and female (n=7) C57B6J mice were cultured in vitro. LPS/IFNγ were used to polarise macrophage to a pro-inflammatory/M1 phenotype and IL-4/IL-13 for anti-inflammatory/M2 polarisation. Gene expression was determined using qPCR. ET-1 concentration was measured by ELISA. Macrophage were then exposed to 2 ng/mL fluorescently-labelled ET-1 (fET-1) and the concentration was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry after 12 hours. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison method. Results Unstimulated macrophagesMale macrophage expressed 2-fold greater ETBR than females (p<0.01). There was no difference in ppET-1 expression between the sexes. Neither male nor female macrophage showed net production of ET-1. Whereas, male macrophage cleared all extracellular ET-1, females cleared none (p<0.05). Polarised macrophages Both male and female macrophage expressed ETBR and ppET-1. Whereas ETBR levels were similar, male macrophage displayed 3-fold greater ppET-1 than females (p<0.05). Net ET-1 production was similar between male and female macrophage (∼20 pg/mL at 24 h). However, male macrophage cleared extracellular ET-1 whereas females did not (p<0.05). Both male and female macrophage expressed ETBR and ppET-1 similarly. Neither males nor females demonstrated net ET-1 production or ET-1 clearance. Conclusions Our data suggest a sex difference in ET system expression and in ET-1 clearance by macrophage. The increased clearance seen with male macrophage is consistent with increased ETBR expression relative to female macrophage. These differences may be important in the cardiovascular risk difference observed between men and women.</p>

        <h2>Face Coverings and Respiratory Tract Droplet Dispersion</h2>
        <h3>L Bandiera, G Pavar, G Pisetta, S Otomo, E Mangano, J R Seckl, P Digard, E Molinari, F Menolascina, I M Viola</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Respiratory droplets are the primary transmission route for SARS-CoV-2, a principle which drives social distancing guidelines. Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we set out to quantify the effects of face coverings on respiratory tract droplet deposition. We tested an anatomically realistic manikin head which ejected fluorescent droplets of water and human volunteers, in speaking and coughing conditions without a face covering, or with a surgical mask or a single-layer cotton face covering. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2 m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5 cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by less than 1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2 m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10 000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 0.5 m away wearing a basic single-layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets and thus provide an opportunity to moderate social distancing policies. However, the methodologies we employed mostly detect larger (non-aerosol) sized droplets. If the aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.</p>

        <h2>Information content analysis reveals desirable aspects of in vivo experiments of a synthetic circuit</h2>
        <h3>DG Cabeza, L Bandiera, E Balsa-Canto, F Menolascina</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Synthetic biology is predicated upon the paradigm of rationally engineering biological systems to enrich them with new functions. Departing from the path outlined by other engineering disciplines, synthetic biology has made limited use of mathematical models so far. Indeed, their laborious inference leverages on noisy data that often provide partial insights into the system behaviour. If the quality of data generated via a perturbation is a road-block to inference, how should we analyse the informativeness of a stimulus? Which are the factors that contribute to it? Here we combine ideas from System Identification and Bayesian inference to quantify the information content of in vivo experiments for the calibration of a deterministic model of the genetic toggle switch. Beyond establishing a link between Bayes- and Fisher Information-based inference approaches, we find a ~ 40% gain can be ascribed to the dynamical properties of the perturbation scheme. Our results hint at the importance of including Bayesian experimental design in the characterisation of synthetic circuits.</p>
